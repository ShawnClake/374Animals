## Overview ##
The [Sask Wildlife] federation has a desire to study the life cycle of animals that live in a certain habitat in Saskatchewan. They would like our students to model their habitat and create a software simulation modelling their life cycle. The animals will be placed in a virtual world and seek out food and will live or die depending on what happens in their world.
